0:17
and strategies to start thinking in
0:19
english
0:20
stop translating in your head and
0:22
increase fluency speaking english and
0:25
what a better way to start 2020 than
0:28
with this goal
0:36
first i want you to name one reason why
0:39
you want to start thinking in english
0:43
i want to learn to think in english so i
0:45
can easily participate in conversation
0:48
whatever your reason is i know it's a
0:51
good one and i think in 2020 you can
0:53
make that happen
0:54
the first tip is to start simple and
0:57
name objects around you in english
Pronunciation
1:00
i remember when i was learning german
1:02
and i was doing this i had to learn the
1:04
article as well deya di das
1:08
their computer
1:10
we don't have that in english but it
1:12
doesn't hurt to really focus on the
1:14
pronunciation as you're thinking of
1:16
simple objects in fact that's why i
1:19
started my youtube channel and even my
1:21
academy when i was learning german
1:23
french and italian as an opera student i
1:25
couldn't find any resources that focused
1:28
enough on pronunciation
1:30
and i knew that to be effective i needed
1:33
the right pronunciation right from the
1:35
beginning so i created my youtube
1:37
channel and my academy to put
1:39
pronunciation
1:40
forward so take a moment as you're
1:42
naming objects to think about
1:44
pronunciation
1:47
closet
1:50
box
1:52
million subscriber button cool
1:56
globe
1:59
window
2:01
and if you're not sure about the
2:02
pronunciation listen to some native
2:04
speakers you can use an online
2:07
dictionary also uglish is a great
2:10
resource for this this record is
2:12
replicated on every computer that uses
2:15
the network computer generated movies
2:18
are really mainstream today something
2:20
that we couldn't possibly do with our
2:21
classical computer they want him to be
2:23
able to distinguish you know the
2:25
telephone from the computer whatever
2:26
they did with him
2:28
computer computer they're all saying
2:31
that with a flap computer
2:35
a flap instead of
2:37
a t sound
2:39
computer
2:40
computer middle syllable stress if you
2:43
can add this step of focusing on the
2:45
pronunciation and listening to native
2:47
speakers awesome
2:49
if not if you only have 15 seconds and
2:51
you're naming as many objects as you can
2:54
that's okay too
2:56
so that's step one and it's simple take
2:59
a moment look around you and name all of
Object Naming
3:02
the objects that you can in english
3:04
if you can do that very easily then you
3:06
can move on but if that's a challenge
3:08
for you spend some time on object naming
3:12
every time you're in a new room a new
3:14
environment take a few seconds to do it
3:17
note words you don't know look them up
3:20
learn them the context will help you
3:23
remember them
3:24
the next step is to think in simple
Simple Sentences
3:26
sentences
3:28
stop right now and think of the
3:30
beginning of a sentence i'm
3:34
i'm hungry i'm tired i'm working
3:37
do it
3:38
in english i'll wait a few seconds
3:40
you're starting with i'm
3:47
now look around you
3:49
what can you say about anything in your
3:51
environment
3:53
this chair is comfy
3:55
the drawer is open
3:58
my desk is messy
4:01
that one's easy because it's almost
4:03
always true
4:05
if there's something you can't describe
4:06
look up the words you need in a
4:08
dictionary memorize it memorize that
4:10
phrase learning in context like this
4:14
will help
4:15
speaking of dictionaries see if you can
4:17
do this
4:18
get an english only dictionary rather
4:20
than a translating dictionary between
4:23
english and your native language
4:25
if you come across the word in english
4:26
that you don't know use the english only
4:28
dictionary a learner's dictionary can
4:31
you see what we're doing here we're
4:33
building your mind to work in english
4:35
mode rather than translation mode there
4:38
is a thing called a learner's dictionary
4:40
and it describes every word in english
4:43
in simple words and terms try it
4:47
miriam webster has one
4:49
oxford cambridge
4:51
and if you have to learn and understand
4:53
a word by reading in english by studying
4:56
what it means in english then you'll
4:58
know it as an english word not as a
5:01
translation of your own language
5:04
so you've named single words and you've
5:06
made simple sentences the next step is
5:09
have small conversations with yourself
Small Conversations
5:11
in english
5:13
with yourself
5:14
yes you don't feel pressured to speak
5:16
quickly to come up with the next thing
5:19
you can keep the pace slow relaxed i
5:22
absolutely did this when learning
5:24
spanish in fact i remember a car trip
5:27
that i did by myself from sarasota to
5:29
gainesville where the whole time i spoke
5:32
to myself in spanish
5:34
if this is hard for you stop and give up
5:37
no it will get better and easier with
5:40
practice do it every day set aside two
5:43
minutes every day to have a simple
5:45
conversation with yourself give yourself
5:48
30 days do this every day for 30 days
5:51
don't take a day off if you have five
5:54
minutes one day do it for five minutes a
5:56
whole conversation as simple as it needs
5:58
to be in english
6:00
in 30 days you'll see
6:02
wow i did improve this is worth my time
6:06
and then rededicate 30 more days
6:10
once you're able to do this i think
6:12
you're able to do step four which is
6:14
really exciting
